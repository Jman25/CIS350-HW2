## Technical Background
For technical background I built my own computer in high school and liked it so much I took a computer basics/networking class. When In college I went into computer engineering, where I learned how to do some C code and code for microcontrollers somewhat. I have since changed to computer science because I just didn't enjoying engineering. In my computer science classes, I have learned java and some python.
