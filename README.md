## Technical Background
For technical backgorund I did build my own computer in high school and liked it so much I took a computer basics/networking class. In college I was doing computer engenerring so I know how to do some c and code a microcontroller somewhat. I have sence changed to computer sciece because I just was not enjoying engenerring. In computer sciece I have learned java and some python.
